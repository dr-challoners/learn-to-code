    <h2>Let's learn to code.</h2>

    <h3>Independent Learning</h3>

    <p>The <span style="color: #800;">Code_Camp</span> challenges are formatted in a way that provide problems to solve, but not direct solutions to them.</p>
    <p>This is much how it would be if you were working with programming and code in your career, and is a good way of practicing - instead of just being given an answer, work it out yourself: this could be through Googling or asking somebody else.</p>


    <h3>Getting things Wrong</h3>

    <p>Be prepared to fail challenges the first time, and second time, and maybe the third and fourth time too.</p>

    <p>The lucky thing is that it doesn't matter. Getting things wrong is a great way to learn, so long as you correct your mistakes. Just don't rush through any problems!</p>


    <h3>The Challenges</h3>

    <p>All the sets of <span style="color: #800;">Code_Camp</span> challenges are split into three sections: 'Just Starting Out', 'Staking out the Middle Ground', and 'Deep into the Zone'.</p>

    <p>The sections' problems get progressively harder, but it's alright - they all include hints to help you out (try not to read them until you've tried the problem with a hint).</p>

    <p>The best way to learn with <span style="color: #800;">Code_Camp</span> challenges is to do them in order - this way, the earlier challenges will give you skills you might need for later challenges.</p>
